</blockquote>\r\n    <p>JSONP并不是一个好的跨域解决方案，它至少有着下面两个严重问题：</p><ol>\r\n    <li><strong>会打乱服务器的消息格式</strong>：JSONP要求服务器响应一段JS代码，但在非跨域的情况下，服务器又需要响应一个正常的JSON格式</li>\r\n    <li><strong>只能完成GET请求</strong>：JSONP的原理会要求浏览器端生成一个<code>script</code>元素，而<code>script</code>元素发出的请求只能是<code>get</code>请求</li>\r\n    </ol>\r\n    <p>所以，CORS是一种更好的跨域解决方案。</p><h1 id=\"article-md-title-1\">概述</h1><p><code>CORS</code>是基于<code>http1.1</code>的一种跨域解决方案，它的全称是<strong>C</strong>ross-<strong>O</strong>rigin <strong>R</strong>esource

<li><strong>需要预检的请求</strong></li>\r\n    <li><strong>附带身份凭证的请求</strong></li>\r\n    </ul>\r\n    <p>这三种模式从上到下层层递进，请求可以做的事越来越多，要求也越来越严格。</p><p>下面分别说明三种请求模式的具体规范。</p><h1
